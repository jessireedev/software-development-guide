# Software Development Guide

This is my personal guide on how to development software. 

## Coding 

* Always decide and be consistent on the verbs so naming conventions can be the same.
* Always consider pagination. 

## System

* For users, an email is defaulty case-insensitive unless stated. Take note of that.
