# Software Development Guide

This is my personal guide on how to development software. 

## Coding 

* Always decide and be consistent on the verbs so naming conventions can be the same.
* Always implement pagination on lists.
* Configure and be consistent on the tab settings. Personally, I prefer two spaces as tabs. Makes it clean.
* Always consider implementing Swagger for BE and unit tests. It helps a lot on building confidence on the software. 

## System

* For users, an email is defaulty case-insensitive unless stated. Take note of that.
